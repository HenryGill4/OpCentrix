The scheduling tool is implemented as an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application. It uses
Entity Framework Core with a SQLite database accessed through `SchedulerContext`.

### Data Model
- **Part** – defines available parts with average duration (`AvgDuration`) and
  a numeric `AvgDurationDays` used to estimate end dates.
- **Job** – represents scheduled work and references a `Part`. Jobs are stored in
  the `Jobs` table and include machine assignment, start/end times, status,
  quantity and optional notes/operator fields.

### Pages
- **/Scheduler** – main scheduling view implemented by `Pages/Scheduler/Index.cshtml`.
  It renders a grid of machines vs dates with partials for job blocks. HTMX is used
  for modal dialogs and partial updates.
- **Partial Views** – `_MachineRow`, `_JobBlock`, and `_AddEditJobModal` handle row
  rendering and job editing.

### Current Scope
Only the scheduler needs completion. Other sections like Machining or EDM are
placeholders. Focus areas include:
- Fixing model inconsistencies noted in `DEBUG_GUIDE.txt`.
- Completing add/edit job workflow and validation.
- Styling the scheduler grid and implementing drag‑drop or other interactions.

The rest of the site can be fleshed out after the scheduler is fully functional.
