*OpCentrix v4.0 Manufacturing Execution System - Complete Implementation*  
*January 26, 2025 - 100% Task Completion Achieved*  
*Ready for Enterprise Production Deployment* ✨

PROMPT 1: Fix duplicate alert notification systems across Admin pages

Context: The application has inconsistent alert implementations:
- Settings.cshtml uses inline fixed position alerts with auto-hide
- Checkpoints.cshtml uses Bootstrap dismissible alerts
- Users.cshtml uses Tailwind fixed position alerts

Requirements:
1. Create a shared partial view _AlertNotifications.cshtml
2. Standardize on Tailwind CSS styling with consistent positioning
3. Implement auto-hide after 5 seconds with smooth animations
4. Support Success, Error, Warning, and Info message types
5. Include icon support for each message type
6. Make it work with both TempData and ViewBag
7. Ensure z-index properly layers over modals

The partial should handle:
- TempData["Success"]
- TempData["Error"] 
- TempData["Warning"]
- TempData["Info"]
- ViewBag equivalents

PROMPT 2: Fix Bootstrap modal form validation issues

Context: Multiple modals across the application have validation problems:
- Checkpoints.cshtml duplicate modal doesn't show validation errors
- Client-side validation isn't properly initialized for dynamically loaded content
- Server-side validation errors don't display in modals after postback

Requirements:
1. Ensure jQuery validation works for all modal forms
2. Display server-side validation errors within modals (not closing them)
3. Add proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
4. Implement loading states on submit buttons
5. Prevent double-submission
6. Show validation summary at top of modal for general errors

Files to fix:
- Pages/Admin/Checkpoints.cshtml (Create and Duplicate modals)
- Pages/Admin/Users.cshtml (User and Password modals)
- Update _ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml if needed

PROMPT 3: Refactor inconsistent JavaScript implementations

Context: The application mixes jQuery, vanilla JavaScript, and inline event handlers:
- Settings.cshtml uses addEventListener
- Checkpoints.cshtml uses mixed jQuery and vanilla JS
- Users.cshtml has inline onclick handlers

Requirements:
1. Create a standardized admin.js file for shared functionality
2. Use consistent event delegation pattern
3. Implement proper error handling for all AJAX calls
4. Add loading states for all async operations
5. Create reusable modal management functions
6. Standardize on either jQuery or vanilla JS (prefer vanilla for performance)
7. Remove all inline event handlers

Common functions needed:
- showModal(modalId)
- hideModal(modalId)
- confirmDelete(message)
- showAlert(type, message)
- initializeValidation(formId)

PROMPT 4: Fix checkbox and boolean field handling

Context: Several issues with checkbox handling:
- Settings.cshtml boolean settings may not submit correctly
- Hidden input fallbacks for checkboxes are inconsistently implemented
- Some forms missing anti-forgery tokens

Requirements:
1. Implement consistent checkbox handling pattern
2. Ensure all POST forms have anti-forgery tokens
3. Add client-side validation for data type constraints
4. Implement proper decimal/number input validation
5. Add input masking for formatted fields
6. Ensure form state is preserved on validation errors

Focus on:
- System Settings boolean values
- User active/inactive status
- Checkpoint required/active flags

PROMPT 5: Add pagination and optimize data loading

Context: Several pages load all records without pagination:
- Checkpoints page loads all checkpoints
- Users page loads all users
- No lazy loading for related data

Requirements:
1. Implement server-side pagination with page size options
2. Add loading indicators for data fetches
3. Optimize Include() statements to prevent N+1 queries
4. Add index hints for common query patterns
5. Implement search debouncing
6. Cache frequently accessed reference data

Target pages:
- Admin/Checkpoints (add pagination)
- Admin/Users (optimize role statistics query)
- Admin/Settings (cache setting lookups)

PROMPT 6: Implement security best practices

Context: Several security considerations need addressing:
- XSS prevention in user-generated content
- SQL injection prevention verification
- Session timeout handling
- Password complexity validation

Requirements:
1. Add HTML encoding for all user inputs displayed
2. Implement CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
3. Add session timeout warnings
4. Enhance password validation rules
5. Add rate limiting for login attempts
6. Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
7. Sanitize file uploads if any

Focus areas:
- User management (password policies)
- Settings management (value sanitization)
- Checkpoint descriptions (XSS prevention)

PROMPT 7: Ensure cross-browser compatibility

Context: Potential issues with:
- CSS Grid/Flexbox in older browsers
- JavaScript ES6+ features
- Form validation API differences

Requirements:
1. Add appropriate polyfills
2. Test and fix IE11 compatibility if required
3. Ensure mobile responsive design works
4. Fix any Safari-specific form issues
5. Test print styles for reports
6. Verify accessibility with screen readers

Key areas:
- Modal behavior on mobile

- Form input types (date, number)

PROMPT 8: Add global error handling and recovery

Context: Need better error handling for:
- AJAX request failures
- Database connection issues
- Validation errors
- Unexpected exceptions

Requirements:
1. Create custom error pages (404, 500, etc.)
2. Implement global exception handler
3. Add retry logic for transient failures
4. Create user-friendly error messages
5. Log errors with context
6. Add error boundaries for JavaScript
7. Implement graceful degradation

Components:
- Global error handler middleware
- Client-side error catching
- Friendly error display component

PROMPT 9: Implement automated testing for critical paths

Context: Need tests for:
