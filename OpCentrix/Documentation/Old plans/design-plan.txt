# Full Design Plan

## 1. Scheduler Grid
- Responsive grid with zoom (day/hour/30min/15min)
- Each row = machine, each column = time slot
- Job blocks stack vertically if overlapping
- Row height auto-calculated based on overlaps

## 2. Data Model
- Job: Id, MachineId, ScheduledStart, ScheduledEnd, PartId, PartNumber, Status, Notes, Operator, Quantity
- Part: Id, PartNumber, Description, Material, AvgDuration, AvgDurationDays
- JobLogEntry: Id, Timestamp, MachineId, PartNumber, Action, Notes, Operator

## 3. Core Features
- Add/Edit/Delete jobs via modal (HTMX)
- Prevent job overlaps per machine
- Auto-calculate end date from part duration
- Show job log (history)
- Show machine hours summary

## 4. UI/UX
- Zoom in/out buttons update grid
- Modal for job add/edit with validation
- Responsive and accessible design
- Show friendly empty state if no jobs

## 5. Logic
- All date range, row height, and stacking logic centralized in backend
- Partial updates always use same logic as full page load
- All changes update summary/footer

## 6. Testing
- Manual: Add, edit, delete jobs at all zoom levels, with/without overlaps
- Automated: Unit test date/row logic if possible

## 7. Deployment
- Remove test data, review config, document setup

This plan should be updated as features/requirements evolve.
