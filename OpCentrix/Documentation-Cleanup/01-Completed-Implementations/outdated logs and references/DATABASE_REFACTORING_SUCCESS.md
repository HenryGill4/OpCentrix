🚨 Critical Issues
1. Parts Table - Severe Table Bloat
•	Issue: The Parts table has grown to ~200+ columns with multiple concerns mixed together
•	Impact: Poor performance, difficult maintenance, violates single responsibility principle
•	Recommendation: Break into multiple related tables:
- - Parts (core part information)
- PartManufacturingStages (manufacturing process data)
- PartCompliance (compliance & regulatory data)
- PartCosts (cost-related fields)
- PartPhysicalProperties (dimensions, weight, etc.)
- PartQualityMetrics (quality scores, defect rates)
1. 2. Generic Stage Columns Anti-Pattern
•	Issue: GenericStage1 through GenericStage5 columns with repeated patterns
•	Impact: Rigid design, cannot handle more than 5 stages, data duplication
•	Recommendation: Create a proper PartStages table with a one-to-many relationship
3. Denormalized Stage-Specific Fields
•	Issue: Separate columns for each manufacturing process (SLS, EDM, Machining, etc.)
•	Impact: Adding new processes requires schema changes
•	Recommendation: Use a ManufacturingProcesses lookup table with a junction table
⚠️ Design Issues
4. Inconsistent Data Type Usage
•	Issue: Mixed use of TEXT for dates instead of proper datetime types
•	Examples: CreatedDate, LastModifiedDate, ScheduledStart, etc.
•	Recommendation: Migrate to proper datetime columns
5. JSON Data in TEXT Columns
•	Issue: Multiple columns store JSON data as TEXT (ProcessParameters, QualityCheckpoints, etc.)
•	Impact: Cannot query JSON data efficiently
•	Recommendation: Use SQLite's JSON functions or normalize into proper tables
6. Missing Foreign Key Constraints
•	Issue: Several relationships appear to be managed in application code
•	Examples: MachineId in Jobs table is TEXT but should reference Machines
•	Recommendation: Add proper foreign key constraints
7. Duplicate Tracking Systems
•	Issue: Multiple job tracking tables with overlapping functionality
•	Jobs, BuildJobs, PrototypeJobs, ArchivedJobs
•	Recommendation: Consolidate into a single job tracking system with proper type discrimination
📊 Performance Concerns
8. Over-Indexing
•	Issue: Many composite indexes that may overlap or be unnecessary
•	Example: Multiple indexes on Parts table covering similar columns
•	Recommendation: Analyze query patterns and remove redundant indexes
9. Wide Tables Impact
•	Issue: Tables with 50+ columns impact query performance
•	Impact: Increased I/O, memory usage, and slower queries
•	Recommendation: Vertical partitioning for rarely accessed columns
10. Text-Based Status Fields
•	Issue: Status fields stored as TEXT throughout the schema
•	Impact: Inefficient comparisons and storage
•	Recommendation: Use integer-based status with lookup tables
🔧 Maintenance Issues
11. Inconsistent Naming Conventions
•	Issue: Mixed naming patterns (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case)
•	Examples: AvgDuration vs AverageActualHours, IsActive vs is_active
•	Recommendation: Adopt consistent naming convention
12. Default Value Proliferation
•	Issue: Excessive use of default values in migrations
•	Impact: Hides data quality issues, makes testing harder
•	Recommendation: Only use defaults where business logic requires
13. Audit Trail Inconsistency
•	Issue: Some tables have CreatedBy/Date, others don't
•	Recommendation: Implement consistent audit fields or separate audit log table
🏗️ Architecture Recommendations
14. Industry-Specific Features
•	Issue: BT (firearms) specific columns mixed with general manufacturing
•	Recommendation: Use inheritance pattern or separate industry-specific tables
15. Document Management
•	Issue: ComplianceDocuments stores file content in database
•	Impact: Database bloat, poor performance
•	Recommendation: Store files externally, keep only metadata in DB
16. User Settings Pattern
•	Issue: UserSettings as separate table with 1:1 relationship
•	Recommendation: Consider EAV pattern or JSON column for flexibility
📋 Proposed Refactoring Priority
1.	High Priority
•	Break up Parts table into logical domains
•	Implement proper datetime columns
•	Fix foreign key relationships
•	Consolidate job tracking tables
2.	Medium Priority
•	Normalize stage-specific fields
•	Implement status lookup tables
•	Clean up indexes
•	Standardize naming conventions
3.	Low Priority
•	Optimize JSON storage
•	Implement audit log system
•	Industry-specific separation
•	Document storage optimization
🚀 Migration Strategy
1.	Create new normalized tables alongside existing ones
2.	Implement data migration scripts
3.	Update application code to use new schema
4.	Run parallel for testing period
5.	Deprecate and remove old tables
This refactoring will result in:
•	Better performance and scalability
•	Easier maintenance and feature additions
•	Improved data integrity
•	More flexible design for future requirements
