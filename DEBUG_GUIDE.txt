The project is an ASP.NET Core web app using EF Core with a SQLite database. The container environment lacks the .NET SDK so the project could not be built or run. Manual inspection reveals several issues:

1. **Model inconsistency**
   - `Migrations` expect `Job` to contain fields such as `Status`, `Notes`, and `Operator`, but `Models/job.cs` currently defines only `Id`, `MachineId`, `ScheduledStart`, `ScheduledEnd`, `PartNumber`, `PartId`, and `Part`. This mismatch will cause database errors. Decide whether to update the model or recreate migrations.
   
2. **Add/Edit Job modal bindings**
   - In `_AddEditJobModal.cshtml` the `Quantity` input reuses the name `Job.PartId`, overwriting the selected Part ID. There is also a textarea bound to `Job.Part.Description` which will not bind correctly. Consider adding properties such as `Quantity` and `Notes` directly on `Job` and update bindings.

3. **Nullable vs non-nullable**
   - Several properties (e.g., `Job.MachineId`, `Job.Part`) are marked nullable yet migrations declare them non-null. Align nullability to avoid runtime errors.

4. **Missing features**
   - Pages like `Machining`, `EDM`, `Shipping`, and `SchedulerTemplate` are placeholders. Implementation work remains for these sections.
   - No test project is present. Adding unit tests and integration tests will help catch issues.
   - Build scripts or CI settings (e.g., `.github/workflows`) still contain template values. Update them for your project.

To proceed:
- Install the .NET 8 SDK locally and run `dotnet ef migrations` to verify model/database alignment.
- Address the binding bugs in the job modal.
- Flesh out remaining pages and add tests to cover scheduling logic.
