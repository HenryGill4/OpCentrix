The project is an ASP.NET Core web app using EF Core with a SQLite database. The container environment lacks the .NET SDK so the project could not be built or run. Manual inspection reveals several issues:

1. **Model inconsistency**
   - `Job` now includes `Status`, `Notes`, `Operator`, `Quantity`, and `PartId` to match the EF Core migrations. Ensure future migrations stay in sync with the model.
   - `Part` now persists `AvgDurationDays` so job end dates can be calculated reliably.
   
2. **Add/Edit Job modal bindings**
   - The quantity and notes fields are correctly bound to `Job.Quantity` and `Job.Notes`. Validate user input before saving.

3. **Nullable vs non-nullable**
   - Several properties (e.g., `Job.MachineId`, `Job.Part`) are marked nullable yet migrations declare them non-null. Align nullability to avoid runtime errors.

4. **Missing features**
   - Pages like `Machining`, `EDM`, `Shipping`, and `SchedulerTemplate` are placeholders. Implementation work remains for these sections.
   - No test project is present. Adding unit tests and integration tests will help catch issues.
   - Build scripts or CI settings (e.g., `.github/workflows`) still contain template values. Update them for your project.

To proceed:
- Install the .NET 8 SDK locally and run `dotnet ef migrations` to verify model/database alignment.
- Review validation logic in the add/edit job modal and extend unit tests when possible.
- Flesh out remaining pages and add tests to cover scheduling logic.
