# ?? **OpCentrix Parts System - RESTORATION SUCCESS SUMMARY**

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ? **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED** - Enhanced Production-Level Functionality Restored  

---

## ?? **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

The OpCentrix Parts system has been **successfully restored and enhanced** with comprehensive manufacturing stage management, individual duration inputs, real-time complexity calculations, and professional UI design.

### **? PHASE 1: ENHANCED MANUFACTURING STAGES TAB - COMPLETED**

**Implemented Features:**
- ? **6 Manufacturing Stage Cards** with individual duration inputs:
  - ??? SLS Printing (print duration, setup, post-processing, supports)
  - ?? CNC Machining (machining time, setup, tool changes)
  - ? EDM Operations (EDM duration, electrode prep, finishing)
  - ?? Assembly (assembly time, component flags, sub-assembly options)
  - ?? Finishing (finishing time, surface types, roughness specs)
  - ?? Quality Inspection (inspection time, FDA/AS9100/NADCAP compliance)

- ? **Expand/Collapse Functionality** with smooth animations and focus management
- ? **Real-time Manufacturing Summary** with dynamic complexity calculation
- ? **Enhanced Admin Override** with validation requiring reason when override is set
- ? **Professional JavaScript** with toggleStageDetails(), updateManufacturingSummary(), validateAdminOverride()

### **? PHASE 2: STAGE INDICATORS IN PARTS LIST - COMPLETED**

**Enhanced Parts List Features:**
- ? **Manufacturing Stages Column** with colored stage badges
- ? **Stage Indicators**: SLS (Blue), CNC (Green), EDM (Yellow), Assembly (Light Blue), Finishing (Gray), QC (Red)
- ? **Stage Count Display** showing total manufacturing stages per part
- ? **Admin Override Indicators** with visual badges and duration comparison
- ? **Enhanced Duration Column** showing effective hours and override status
